# OOPs-Challenge
Various Attributes used:
make (string): The make of the car (e.g., Hyundai, Maruti, BMW)
model (string): The model of the car (e.g., Alto, Creta, City)
year (int): The year the car was made
speed (int): The current speed of the car in miles per hour
x (int): The x-coordinate of the car
y (int): The y-coordinate of the car

I have used various methods in class:
accelerate(speed_incrementx, speed_incrementy): This method should take an argument that represents the speed increment and increase the speed of the car by that amount.
brake(speed_decrementx, speed_decrementx): This method should take an argument that represents the speed decrement and decrease the speed of the car by that amount.
move(time): This method should update the x and y coordinates of the car based on its current speed.
detect_collision(car2): This method take an argument that represents another car and return True if the two cars have collided, and False otherwise.
